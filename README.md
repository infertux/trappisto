# Trappisto

## WTF is that name?

[TRAPPIST-1](http://www.trappist.one/#about) is a planetary system located 12 parsecs away from the Solar system.
But before we get to explore another planetary system, we can explore our very own blockchain in the Solar system and since the number zero is preceding one:
`TRAPPIST-1 -> TRAPPIST-0 -> TRAPPIST0 -> Trappist0 -> Trappisto`. Yeah I know.
